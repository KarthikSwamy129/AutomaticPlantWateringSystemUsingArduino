Automatic Plant Watering System (Arduino + Embedded C)

This project automatically waters plants based on soil moisture level using an Arduino microcontroller.

Components:
- Arduino Uno
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Relay Module
- Water Pump
- Jumper Wires & Power Supply

Working:
- The soil moisture sensor measures the soil's water content.
- If moisture drops below a threshold, Arduino triggers the relay to run the pump.
- Pump stops once soil moisture is adequate.

Usage:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `Automatic_Plant_Watering.ino` in Arduino IDE.
3. Upload to Arduino board.
4. Adjust `threshold` based on your sensor readings.
